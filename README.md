# Avala Playground

This repo contains everything you need to try out Avala outside the competition environment. It includes the following:

- **Client workspace**: Example of what you should have in your local environment for developing and running exploits, with some fake exploits for trying out.
- **Mock game infra**: Mock service that generates random flag IDs and mock services that accept flags via HTTP and TCP.
- **Server workspace**: Example server configuration that works with the mock game infra.

## Getting started

Launch all containers in the following order:

1. Run mock infrastructure

    Review `compose.yaml` and adjust settings such as timezones or ports if needed. When done, run the containers using Docker Compose.

    ```console
    $ docker compose -f mock/compose.yaml up -d
    ```

2. Run server component

    Review all the files in `server` dictionary and modify according to the docs. Since multiple Docker networks are being created, it's recommended to use your machine's private IP address (run `hostname -I` and use the address beginning with `192`). Adjust settings in `compose.yaml` such as timezones, ports and similar.

    ```console
    $ docker compose -f server/compose.yaml up -d
    ```

3. Setup client environment

    Client environment is preconfigured to work with the configuration provided in `avala.yaml` file. To start playing with the Avala client, install `avala-ad` in a virtual environment and start running commands.

    ```console
    $ cd client
    $ python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install avala-ad
    Successfully installed avala-ad-0.1.0
    ```
    ```console
    $ avl exploits
